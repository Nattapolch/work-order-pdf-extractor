# Performance Improvements for WO Extractor

## Summary of Optimizations

This performance optimization branch implements significant improvements to handle processing 100+ PDF files efficiently.

## Key Changes

### 1. Concurrent Processing
- **Before**: Sequential processing of PDFs one by one
- **After**: Concurrent processing using `ThreadPoolExecutor` with configurable worker count
- **Default**: 5 concurrent workers for API calls
- **Benefit**: 3-5x faster processing for large batches

### 2. API Call Optimization
- **Retry Logic**: Added exponential backoff retry mechanism (3 attempts)
- **Timeout**: Set 30-second timeout for API calls
- **Image Optimization**: 
  - Use JPEG format with 85% quality (smaller payload)
  - Low detail mode for faster processing
  - Reduced max_tokens from 300 to 150
- **Temperature**: Lowered to 0.1 for consistent results

### 3. PDF Conversion Optimization
- **DPI Reduction**: Reduced from 200 to 150 DPI for faster conversion
- **Thread Count**: Use 2 threads for pdf2image conversion
- **PyMuPDF Optimization**: Reduced zoom from 2.0x to 1.5x

### 4. Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: Progress updates as tasks complete
- **Performance Metrics**: Processing rate (files/sec) and ETA
- **Batch Logging**: Progress logged every 10 files
- **Total Time**: Complete timing statistics

### 5. Error Handling Improvements
- **Graceful Failures**: Failed files don't stop entire batch
- **Task Cancellation**: Proper cancellation of remaining tasks when stopped
- **Better Logging**: Reduced verbose logging for performance

## Configuration Options

New configuration parameters in the class:

```python
self.max_concurrent_workers = 5    # API call concurrency
self.pdf_processing_workers = 8    # PDF conversion workers (future use)
self.batch_size = 10              # Progress update frequency
```

## Expected Performance Gains

| File Count | Sequential Time | Concurrent Time | Speedup |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| 10 files   | ~5 minutes     | ~1-2 minutes    | 3-4x    |
| 50 files   | ~25 minutes    | ~6-8 minutes    | 3-4x    |
| 100 files  | ~50 minutes    | ~12-15 minutes  | 3-4x    |

*Note: Actual performance depends on API response times and system resources*

## Testing

Use the included `performance_test.py` script to benchmark improvements:

```bash
python performance_test.py
```

## Safety Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Limited to 5 concurrent workers to respect API limits
- **Memory Usage**: Concurrent processing uses more memory
- **Error Recovery**: Robust error handling prevents crashes
- **Stop Function**: Can safely stop processing mid-batch

## Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible. Existing functionality remains unchanged while gaining performance benefits.

## Recommended Usage

For 100+ PDF files:
1. Ensure stable internet connection
2. Monitor API usage and costs
3. Use appropriate concurrent worker count (3-8 depending on system)
4. Consider processing in smaller batches if memory limited
